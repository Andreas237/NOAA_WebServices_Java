# NOAA_WebServices_Java

**Genesis:**
I have always been interested in weather.  I started a project working with E*TRADE's API to create a robo-trader.  After hitting hurdles even using the API I figured analyzing weather would be a better start, and [NOAA's APIs](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#data) were an easy thing to use.

**Summary:**
I learned how to:
-open a connection passing headers
-receive a response
-process a variety of responses
-allow a user to interact with the API in real time

**//TO DO:**
My goal is to store the data in an SQL database and open that connection everytime the app starts, and only read in new data.
I would also like to host the app in my Amazon instance.
Unfortunately I am poor since I quit my job to work toward a computer science masters and thus my laptop is weak, and I don't want to pay for Amazon...  RaspberryPi I'm looking at you.
